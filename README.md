#### Hi, guys. I am <strong>Song Zhou</strong>.

I created this small project.<br>

- I got boared one night and coded (just for fun) a Node.js program for auto-deployment using webhook provided by Github.<br>
- If this project helps you a little, I would be really pleased if you <b>Star</b> this project and <b>Follow</b> me.<br>
- It's really light and super easy to use. Hope you guys enjoy it. : )

<br>
### How to run this project?
1. Clone the repo [@Github](http://github.com/RoyTimes/github_hook)<br>
2. Install the NPM dependencies by `npm install`<br>
3. Write your repo settings into `repos.json`<br>
4. Finally, just `nohup npm start` the project!<br>

DONE!

<hr>
There would be a beautiful static web page runs on `localhost` and when there is a `POST` request onto `localhost/deploy` the program would run the cmd written in the JSON file : )  That's all for it!
